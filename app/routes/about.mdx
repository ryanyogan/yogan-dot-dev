    Because this is a thing now, I guess?

  <p className="leading-8">
    Embarking on my tech journey with a 386 computer, I quickly became
    the family IT department, graduating from building PCs to
    conjuring AOL "proggies" in Visual Basic. My love affair with
    server racks in chilly rooms was just the beginning, and my entry
    into theater! Fast forward through a symphony of C#, PHP spells, and
    Rails-powered rollercoasters, and you'll find me professing my
    love for all things engineering. These days, I'm crafting video
    game masterpieces in Rustâ€”so "unique" they're practically art, and
    hoarding leadership books like they're going out of style. My
    toolkit? A kaleidoscope of TypeScript frameworks so infamous, they
    dare not speak their names.

    I've navigated the startup scene from a cozy nook above a Chicago
    bar to the dizzying heights of corporate skyscrapers, only to
    realize my living room beats them all. Amidst a quirky
    relationship with Emacs and Clojure (we're complicated), I find
    Zen in configuring Neovim more than I do in housekeeping. I
    occasionally pine for the days of wrestling with ColdFusion, Perl,
    and coaxing that last table and gif into pixel-perfect harmony for
    IE6â€”ah, simpler times.

    My home doubles as an aircraft hangar, thanks to an obsession with
    tinkering on aircrafts and simulators. I've taken "home office" to
    new altitudes, recreating a commercial flight experience that's
    just one cranky passenger short of actual takeoff.
