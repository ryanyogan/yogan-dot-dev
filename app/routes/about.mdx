# About
### Never stop stopping...

I'm just a simple dev, I swear it's true,
I code in Rails, Django, and Elixir too.
From Node to .NET, I don't discriminate,
I love them all, no need to debate.

I'm so humble, I'm just a coding fiend,
From Swift to React, my code's always lean.
I'm so humble, watch me merge without a glitch,
I'm so humble, I even code in VIM, ain't that a switch?

SQL and BASH, old friends of mine,
We've been through so much, line by line.
let versus const, I've seen the fights,
But in the end, it's about the sites.

I've been around since the iPhone's birth,
Seen tech trends come and go on Earth.
But through it all, one thing remains,
It's the love for code that flows through my veins.

I'm so humble, with every framework I juggle,
I'm so humble, my code never in a muddle.
I'm so humble, I make this clear,
With every project, I bring cheer.

So here's to humility, in a world so vast,
Where languages come, and frameworks pass.
But one thing's constant, my humble approach,
In a world of code, I'm still your coach.
