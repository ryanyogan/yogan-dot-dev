      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-10">2024 will be a year of personal growth</h2>
      I have a personal "OKR" that I will work on being open, I will ask for help 
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7161089259175645184/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">with humility, in the open, avoiding my fears</a>, and start writing again.
      Let's see if I can stick to it this time. I may ramble about leadership, engineering, 
      life, aviation... why not, my parents are a majority of my traffic, hi mom 👋.  Perhaps I may
      help that one individual who is struggling with the same things I have struggled with. 🤷


      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-10">Okay, here is what Chat GPT has to say about me</h2>

      Embarking on my tech journey with a 386 computer, I quickly became
      the family IT department, graduating from building PCs to
      conjuring AOL "proggies" in Visual Basic. My love affair with
      server racks in chilly rooms was just the beginning, and my entry
      into theater! Fast forward through a symphony of C#, PHP spells, and
      Rails-powered rollercoasters, and you'll find me professing my
      love for all things engineering. These days, I'm crafting video
      game masterpieces in Rust—so "unique" they're practically art, and
      hoarding leadership books like they're going out of style. My
      toolkit? A kaleidoscope of TypeScript frameworks so infamous, they
      dare not speak their names.

      I've navigated the startup scene from a cozy nook above a Chicago
      bar to the dizzying heights of corporate skyscrapers, only to
      realize my living room beats them all. Amidst a quirky
      relationship with Emacs and Clojure (we're complicated), I find
      Zen in configuring Neovim more than I do in housekeeping. I
      occasionally pine for the days of wrestling with ColdFusion, Perl,
      and coaxing that last table and gif into pixel-perfect harmony for
      IE6—ah, simpler times.

      My home doubles as an aircraft hangar, thanks to an obsession with
      tinkering on aircrafts and simulators. I've taken "home office" to
      new altitudes, recreating a commercial flight experience that's
      just one cranky passenger short of actual takeoff.

      <h2 className="text-lg font-bold mt-10">What matters most to me?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>👨‍👩‍👦‍👦 is my love.</li>
        <li>🛩 is my joy.</li>
        <li>🎸 is my jam.</li>
        <li>🐕 & 🐈‍⬛ pain in the ass.</li>
        <li>🚙 detailing cars is my zen.</li>
        <li>🏒 full-time ice dad.</li>
