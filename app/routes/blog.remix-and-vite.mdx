[Remix and Vite](https://remix.run/blog/remix-vite-stable) are officially offiical. This is a kind of a big deal and I love it.

#### Door Unlocked

> The most significant change weâ€™ve made is so important that weâ€™ll reserve discussing its impact on the React ecosystem for a later post. 

> The short version is that Remix now supports building purely static sites that donâ€™t require a JavaScript server in production, all while keeping the benefits of Remixâ€™s file based route conventions, automatic code splitting, route module prefetching, head tag management and more.

> This unlocks an entirely new migration path for React Router consumers to move to Remix without having to switch to a server-rendered architecture â€” which for many people isnâ€™t even an option. And for anyone that wants to introduce a server to their Remix app in the future, the migration path is now much more straightforward.
