## Let's have a funny look at 2023

I had this fantastic idea last year to start writing, as a way to keep my thoughts in order and to share some of the
things I have learned over the years.  I have been a developer for a long time, and I have learned a lot of things
that I think are worth sharing.

So I build the site, then I rebuild it in a new framework, tweak the UI for a week, and I wrote a sample post.

> Here is where the real magic begins! Nothing, the site goes dormant, rinse and repeat year after year.

I can laugh about this now as I have become more open about my ADHD, and I have learned to embrace it.  

There is a very long post coming out about overcoming some odd fears and struggles, I opened up on [LinkedIn][linked-in] and slowly
crawled back to the internets.  That will be long, and I need time to digest everything for that, and a proper way to thank 
so many people that came to help me.  I love you all, and I am so grateful for the support.  This is not that post.

Ah, crap, there is that ADHD... let's have a look at my work over the past year ü§£

### The majestic unicorn of a blog is built!
> More like you looked at Leerob.io's blog and said ~ Nice, I like this design, I can build that without looking at the source.

#### The landing page
So full of wonder and excitment.  Random quotes from actors, two stub links to posts that don't exist,
and a link to the about page.  The about page, a single paragraph about me.

A link to some photos of our animals, and one actual bit of decent information, the giving back...

Okay, so it's not all bad, but it's not great either.

![The Blog](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/old-site-blog.webp "The Blog")

#### The blog posts
Absolutely riveting, I know.  I mean, I have a post about a post that I am going to write, and a post about
about August.  I mean, who doesn't want to read about August?

This was the blood, sweat, and tears of 2023, it seems my commitment to writing was not as strong as I thought,
and a few months late; I am back to the drawing board.

![The Projects](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/old-site-projects.webp "The Projects")

#### The projects
Interesting that my side-hobby includes building random SaaS projects, and then hosting them on the edge,
paying for their databases... For the simple satisifcation of pulling my phone out and playing a toy app lol.

I like to do this, I will continue to do this, building or cloning randomg projects is an awesome way to learn.

I spent a lot of time with Next.js and Remix this past year, coming to the conclusing... I like them both, a lot,
weidly I do not see the big whoop and will gladly use either.  Remix adding Vite was dope, this site is Remix and I
am writing a few tutorials that use Remix as well.  Shit, on topic Ryan! ü§£

![The Zoo](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/old-site-zoo.webp "The Zoo")

#### The zoo?
Seriously?  Okay never again, I cannot belive I started putting more love into making pictures of our animals
edge accessible across the globe, than I did any content.

I also cannot believe I became that person... at all, oh well, I do love our little critters so much ‚ù§Ô∏è


### 2024 - I rebooted three times
I decided recently I want to write, ramble, get over some fears, and maybe I can teach a thing or two. 

Naturally, what I had was not good enough, nor was any template available for Next, React, Astro, HTML, whatever, nope I had to
build a new site before I could write a word.

![The First](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/wasted-a-day.webp "The First")

#### There goes a couple free days worth of time
I started with an interesting day of changing colors, fonts and margins.  Naturally I had to use the latest and greatest
of everything, and I had to make it all work together. 

I had just finished cranking out a slew of larger Next applications using the app router and a mix of RSC with tRPC.
I went with Next per usual, and started getting flashy.

![The Now](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/popstar.webp "The Now")

#### Watch movie, simple, go!    
I was watching [Pop Star][pop-star] with my better-half per usual, and I was laughing at the scene where they are trying to write
Incredible Thoughts.

üí° I need to weave humor and what I love into this whole maintaining writing and teaching.
I have no idea why this is how my brain thinks, who cares, it worked :)

It need to be different, stop chasing what everyone else is, that is not you!  I always loved using niche 
tools like Elixir, Clojure, Emacs, and I have always loved the idea of being different.  

So here I am, for the first time in years off Vercel, running all over the globe on Fly.io with Remix.  I will 
write and article on Remix and why I have loved it for two years now, also why I love Next.js and will continue
to use both.
