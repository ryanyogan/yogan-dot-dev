## Let's have a funny look at 2023

I had this fantastic idea last year to start writing to keep my thoughts in order and share some of the
things I have learned over the years. I have been a developer for a long time, and I have learned many things worth sharing.

So I built the site, rebuilt it in a new framework, tweaked the UI for a week, and wrote a sample post.

> Here is where the real magic begins! Nothing, the site goes dormant, rinse and repeat year after year.

I can laugh about this now as I have become more open about my ADHD, and I have learned to embrace it.  

There is a long post about overcoming odd fears and struggles; I opened up on [LinkedIn][linked-in] and slowly
crawled back to the internet. That will be long, and I need time to digest everything for that, and a proper way to thank 
so many people that came to help me. I love you all, and I am so grateful for your support. 

Ah, crap, there is that ADHD... let's have a look at my work over the past year ü§£

### The majestic unicorn of a blog is built!
> More like you looked at Leerob.io's blog and said ~ Nice, I like this design; I can build that without looking at the source.

#### The landing page
So full of wonder and excitement. Random quotes from actors, two stub links to posts that don't exist,
and a link to the About page. The About page is a single paragraph about me.

Here is a link to some photos of our animals and some decent information about giving back...

Okay, it's not all bad, but it's not great.

#### The blog posts
Absolutely riveting, I know. I have a post about a post that I will write and a post about.
August. Who wants to avoid reading about August?

This was the blood, sweat, and tears of 2023; it seems my commitment to writing was not as strong as I thought,
and a few months later, I am back to the drawing board.

![The Projects](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/old-site-projects.webp "The Projects")

#### The projects
My side hobby is building random SaaS projects and hosting them on the edge,
paying for their databases... For the simple satisfaction of pulling my phone out and playing a toy app, lol.

I like to do this and will continue; building or cloning random projects is a terrific way to learn.

I spent much time with Next.js and Remix this past year, coming to the conclusion... I like them both a lot
; I do not see the big whoop and will gladly use them both. Remix adding Vite was dope. This site is Remix, and I
am also writing a few tutorials that use Remix. Shit, on topic, Ryan! ü§£

![The Zoo](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/old-site-zoo.webp "The Zoo")

#### The zoo?
Seriously? Okay, never again, I cannot believe I started putting more love into making pictures of our animals
edge accessible across the globe, then I did any content.

I also cannot believe I became that person... at all; oh well, I do love our little critters so much ‚ù§Ô∏è


### 2024 - I rebooted three times
I decided recently to write, ramble, get over some fears, and maybe I can teach a thing or two. 

Naturally, what I had was not good enough, nor was any template available for Next, React, Astro, HTML, whatever, nope I had to
build a new site before I could write a word.

![The First](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/wasted-a-day.webp "The First")

#### There goes a couple free days' worth of time
I started with an exciting day of changing colors, fonts, and margins. Naturally I had to use the latest and greatest
of everything, and I had to make it all work together. 

I had just finished cranking out a slew of larger Next applications using the app router and a mix of RSC with tRPC.
I went with Next per usual, and started getting flashy.

![The Now](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhujko6ey/image/upload/v1708555171/blog/popstar.webp "The Now")

#### Watch a movie, stay simple, go!    
I was watching [Pop Star][pop-star] with my better half per usual, and I was laughing at the scene where they are trying to write
Incredible Thoughts.

üí° I need to weave humor and what I love into this whole maintaining writing and teaching.
I have no idea why this is how my brain thinks; who cares? It worked :)

It needs to be different; stop chasing what everyone else is; that is not you! I always loved using niche 
tools like Elixir, Clojure, and Emacs, and I have always loved the idea of being different.  

So here I am, for the first time in years off Vercel, running all over the globe on Fly.io with Remix. I will 
write an article on Remix and why I have loved it for two years now, as why I love Next.js and will continue
to use both.

### The hilarious discourse that is Ryan's brain

I am going to write, I am going to teach, and I am going to be me. I am going to be different, and I am going to
be okay with that.  

I am going to take a *long* time to get content out ü§£

As you can üëÄ, I had to create several new websites to get a post out.

Believe it or not, this is progress, I never make it past the creation of the new site!
